### About Me

I am Samikshya Pahari and I'm currently a senior in Southern New Hampshire University majoring in Biology. I am originally from Kathmandu, Nepal but me and my family moved to the U.S. in 2019. After graduating, I'm planning to pursue my career in healthcare, possibly going to the medical field. Currently at SNHU, I am working as UGR catalyst where with my team I help to organize the event called Undergraduate Research Day. Also, I work as a student assistant for Global Education Movement where I help record transctipts and diplomas of the students and mail them. I also volunteered in Dartmouth-Hitchcock where I helped patients with directions and any other questions they might have. I had also been a part of ESL program and volunteered to be an English teacher in Japan.

### Research Projects

I have been working with other group of students and professor to research about the chytrid fungus in the frogs which causes disease called chytridomycosis. Also, I worked with one of the other professor on seeing the potential use of bacteria that can produce calcium carbonate to heal the concrete. I have gained a valuable skills like pipetting, gel electrophoresis and PCR through this project. Hopefully, in the future I would be able to work in some kind of research as well!
