### About Me

I am Samikshya Pahari, and I'm currently a senior at Southern New Hampshire University majoring in Biology. I am originally from Kathmandu, Nepal, but I and my family moved to the U.S. in 2019. After graduating, I'm planning to pursue a healthcare career, possibly going into the medical field. Currently, at SNHU, I am working as a UGR catalyst, where, with my team, I help organize the Undergraduate Research Day event. Also, I work as a student assistant for the Global Education Movement, where I help record transcripts and diplomas of the students and mail them. I also volunteered at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, where I helped patients with directions and any other questions they might have. I had also been a part of an ESL program and volunteered to be an English teacher in Japan.


### Research Projects on campus

I have been working with another group of students and professors to research the chytrid fungus in frogs, which causes a disease called chytridiomycosis. Also, I worked with one of the other professors on seeing the potential use of bacteria that can produce calcium carbonate to heal the concrete. I have gained valuable skills like pipetting, gel electrophoresis, and PCR through this project. Hopefully, in the future, I will be able to work in some kind of research as well!


### Projects on Bioinformatics

#### Palmer Penguins

Using R code, we learned how to analyze the penguins data and manipulate the data. We also used ggplot to visualize the data using bar graph, and scatterplots to compare between two or more categorical or numerical datas. [here](<https://samikshyapahari.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/Palmer Penguins_SP.html>)  

#### Dog Breed

From the dog data set, we chose top 10 popular hunting and comapnion dogs to compare if hunting dogs can be as friendly as companion dogs. Using ggplot to visualize data using scatterplot, we came into conclusion that hunting dogs could be friendlier and trained as companion dogs except for exception like Shiba Inu and Bloodhounds. [here](<https://samikshyapahari.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/Dog Breed.html>)  

#### RNA Sequencing
 
RNA Seq I: Using the edgeR, we analyzed the RNA-seq data from the R Bioinformatics Cookbook called modencodefly which contains the data on _Drosophila melanogaster_. [here](<https://samikshyapahari.github.io/BioInformatics/RNA Seq I.html>) <br/>
RNA Seq II: Using dataset at_tf_gex, we created the heatmap of the ecotype and plant parts and see how gene is expressed differetly in two or more different samples. [here](<https://samikshyapahari.github.io/BioInformatics/RNA Seq II.html>)<br/>
Phylogetic analysis and visualization: Creating the evolutionary tree from mammal phylogeny from dataset. [here](<https://samikshyapahari.github.io/BioInformatics/Phylogenetic analysis and Visualization>)<br/>
